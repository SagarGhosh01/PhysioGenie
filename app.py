Symptoms: Red or ulcerated areas, possibly from irritation.

Leukoplakia or Oral Cancer:

Symptoms: Persistent white or red patches that do not heal after 2 weeks.
Cause: Chronic irritation (e.g., smoking, alcohol), immune dysfunction, or cancer.
Action:

Eggs, dairy, lean meat, fish.
Leafy greens, beans, and fortified cereals.

3. Visit a Healthcare Professional
When to consult:
If lesions persist for more than 2 weeks.
If pain is severe or affects eating and speaking.
If there is unusual growth or persistent white/red patches.
4. Professional Treatments
Your doctor may prescribe:
Antifungals: If a fungal infection is suspected.
Antivirals: If viral lesions (e.g., herpes) are involved.
Vitamin supplements: If deficiencies are confirmed.
Biopsy: If there is suspicion of precancerous or cancerous growth.
